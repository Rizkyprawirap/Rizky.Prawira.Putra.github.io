										<h1>About Me</h1>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Hello!, My name is Rizky Prawira Putra, Currently, I'm studying at Bina Nusantara University and majoring in Computer
									Science, I took Database technology as my stream course. Since college, I have learned some programming languages such
									as C/C++, Java, R, PHP, Javascript, and Python.<br>Then I also learn anything about databases like how to create a database using SQL Server, MySQL, and others, Also I
									learn about how to build an android application by using android studio(Java). I would like to work with these
									programming languages for real cases that could help others. I have an interest to become an Android developer, Data
									analyst, or Back-End Developer.</p>
									<p>Why do I want to be an Android Developer? the reason is that in the 5th semester I got mobile programming course that
									makes me need to learn about android, its so interesting, and that's made me want to become an android developer. Also
									why Data analysts? it's because in Big Data and Data Mining Course I have to do some analysis with a lot of data set I
									thought it would be hard and make me desperate, well it's not because It's actually fun to get into it. and the last is
									a back-end developer that's because I want to implement all that I have learned in college to the real-world case.</p>
									
									<p>In addition to improving my knowledge and hard skills during my college days, I am also active in organizational
									activities. I participated in the BDM student activity unit (Bersama Dalam Musik) in the year I was in charge, I became
									the coordinator of public relations for the Kemanggisan region. what I do is make captions for Instagram, broadcast,
									news, and article for the website, besides that, I was also the website coordinator for BDM. Besides that, I also joined
									the HIMTI Student Association (Himpunan Teknik Informatika) Binus University, at HIMTI I became an ordinary activist but
									I was quite active and participated in several events held by HIMTI (events listed on LinkedIn). therefore I believe
									that I get the soft skills that I want such as cooperation, communication, leadership, adaptation, problem-solving, and
									time management.</p>
