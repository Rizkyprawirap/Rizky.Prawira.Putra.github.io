									<p>Hello!, My name is Rizky Prawira Putra, Currently, I'm studying at Bina Nusantara University and majoring in Computer
									Science, I took Database technology as my stream course. Since college, I have learned some programming languages such
									as C/C++, Java, R, PHP, Javascript, and Python.<br>Then I also learn anything about databases like how to create a database using SQL Server, MySQL, and others</p>
									
									<p>In addition to improving my knowledge and hard skills during my college days, I am also active in organizational
									activities. I participated in the BDM student activity unit (Bersama Dalam Musik) in the year I was in charge, I became
									the coordinator of public relations for the Kemanggisan region. what I do is make captions for Instagram, broadcast,
									news, and article for the website, besides that, I was also the website coordinator for BDM. Besides that, I also joined
									the HIMTI Student Association (Himpunan Teknik Informatika) Binus University, at HIMTI I became an ordinary activist but
									I was quite active and participated in several events held by HIMTI (events listed on LinkedIn). therefore I believe
									that I get the soft skills that I want such as cooperation, communication, leadership, adaptation, problem-solving, and
									time management.</p>
